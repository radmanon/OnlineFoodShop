Online Food Shop is a website that makes any resturants able to having orders online from their customers.
It was a premade django backend, but I edited and developed it.
I changed the basic UI of this project to more friendly UI and I added some poperties like make a log for delivery and the manager can see the status of the order.
 for example who is ordered and who is delivered this order in when.
and i added a profile panel for have a required details for customers to use them for customers accounts.
and in this project there is separated panels for staffs to check and manage orders.

also you can test this website at http://radmanon.pythonanywhere.com/
